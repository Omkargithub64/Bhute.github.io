           <p>Raccoons are mid-sized animals that are about 2-3 feet long. Their bodies are stocky, round and covered in salt-and-pepper colored fur. Raccoons are known best for the “black mask” of fur around their eyes, also known as a “bandit mask,” and black rings around their furry tails.</p>
           <p>Raccoons prefer to live in forested areas near a water source. Although commonly found in association with water and trees, raccoons can also be found around farmsteads and livestock watering areas. Raccoons typically like to den in hollow trees, ground burrows, brush piles, muskrat houses, barns and abandoned buildings, dense clumps of cattail, haystacks or rock crevices. They are also known to use parts of homes, including chimneys, attics, and hollow areas beneath porches to make dens. </p>
           <p>They are omnivores, meaning they will eat both plants and other animals. This includes fruits, berries, nuts, fish, frogs, mussels, crayfish, insects, turtles, mice, rabbits, muskrats and bird eggs. Raccoons usually have one litter per year, which is usually born in late spring or early summer. One litter may contain between three and five young. Raccoons can live as long as 12 years in the wild. They do not hibernate but do become inactive during severe winter weather.</p>
